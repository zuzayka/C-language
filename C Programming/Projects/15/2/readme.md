### Project 15.02
Modify the `justify` program of Section 15.3 by having the `read_word` function
(instead of `main`) store the `*` character at the end of a word thatâ€™s been truncated.

### Solution
All files given in Section "15.3 Dividing a Program into Files" than `main.c` (analogue of `justify.c`), `word.c` and `word.h` have no changes. 
For compiling and linking I use `QtCreator` with `CMake`. See `main.c`, `word.c`, `word.h` and `CMakeLists.txt`
